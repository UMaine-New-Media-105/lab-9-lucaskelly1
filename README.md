My code:

For this Lab, we were to create about 20 balls that bounce along the sides of the canvas-- in the x direction an the y direction. To do this, an array must be used to be as efficient as possible. Also, a loop should be used to draw all 20 balls on the canvas. 

In my code, I only included 5 balls that bounced along the sides of the canvas. Unfortunatly, the balls dip below the canvas but then appear again after a few seconds.
